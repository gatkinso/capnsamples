# Welcome to CapnSamples!

A menagerie of CapnProto sample applications!

Most of the samples are in C++, but I am not picky. Feel free to request samples of all
kinds.  However I must tell you now... Java... I dislike Java.  That said, I'll put 
Java samples in here.  I have an open mind.

Basically I decided to whip this from the frustration that arose with the samples
provided with CapnProto (which is awesome... my frustration ends with the samples).  I figure 
a sample should start off with Hello World.  Not a darn phone book.  Please.

Anyway, enjoy!

# About CapnProto

CapnProto is a serialization and RPC library created by one of the original authors of Google 
Protocol buffers.  Basically, a massive speed and resource improvement.  And, IMO a return
to sanity.  I am not sure why, but Protocol Buffers seems to have jumped the shark.  Sad really.

So, checkout CapnProto already!
